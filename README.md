Hi Professor! Here are some instructions on how to access the site.
1) You'll need to download the zip folder under the "Code" button.
2) Then upzip the folder in your File Explorer OR just copy the inner folder to a location that is not zipped.
3) Within that folder, open the "index.html" file in your browser and you should be able to access the website!
