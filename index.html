            <p>
              Food quality in the United States is lower than in any other country when evaluated across major food groups. This difference is clear through comparisons of processing levels and nutritional standards in foods such as grains, dairy, and produce. Understanding these disparities matters because lower food quality directly affects public health and long-term dietary outcomes in the United States.

            <p>
              Fortification is the addition of nutrients to foods to maintain or improve overall nutritional quality (FDA).
              Under U.S. regulations, milk has required minimums for certain nutrients, including <strong>Vitamin A</strong> and
              <strong>Vitamin D</strong>, and companies may add additional nutrients voluntarily. Flavoring ingredients (fruit/juice)
              and natural/artificial flavorings may also be added under FDA rules (eCFR).
            </p>
            <p>
              In Europe, Vitamin D fortification is not universally required. Because milk is a major source of Vitamin D in U.S. diets,
              this may contribute to fewer Vitamin D deficiency cases in the U.S. than in Europe, where populations may get less Vitamin D from milk.

            <summary>Pasteurization differences (U.S. vs Europe)</summary>
            <p>
              Pasteurization is a heat process designed to kill harmful bacteria and prevent spoilage (Cornell CALS). In the U.S., the
              most common method is <strong>HTST</strong> (high temperature, short time). In Europe, <strong>UHT</strong> (ultra-high temperature)
              processing is more common. UHT uses a higher temperature for an even shorter time, producing shelf-stable milk that can be stored
              without refrigeration (Shojai).
            </p>
            <p>
              The FDA notes that pasteurization is important for consumer safety and warns against raw milk due to pathogen risk. Research cited by the FDA
              indicates pasteurization method differences do not cause significant changes in nutritional value (FDA).

              In Europe, hormones like rBST aren’t allowed, so “hormone-free” claims are less relevant. In the U.S., hormones are allowed,
              but whether rBST was used does not have to be clearly labeled. Labeling like <strong>“rBST-free”</strong> is voluntary and many producers
              do not include it (Massachusetts Department of Public Health).

              In the U.S., fluid milk consumption has declined, but overall dairy consumption has increased because Americans eat more processed dairy
              products like cheese, butter, and yogurt (Dairy News). In Europe, total dairy consumption has plateaued and in some areas is decreasing,
              linked to plant-based alternatives and changing eating habits (Open Knowledge).

              Increased intake of saturated fats is concerning because it can raise harmful cholesterol and contribute to heart disease and obesity.

            Fresh produce generally retains more fiber and vitamins than processed versions. Processing (canning, juicing, pureeing)
            can reduce nutrient density and often adds sugars/sodium/preservatives. Access also varies: low-income areas face food deserts,
