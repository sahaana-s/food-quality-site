            <p>
              Food quality in the United States is lower than in any other country when evaluated across major food groups. This difference is clear through comparisons of processing levels and nutritional standards in foods such as grains, dairy, and produce. Understanding these disparities matters because lower food quality directly affects public health and long-term dietary outcomes in the United States.

Many U.S. wheat products rely on <strong>hard wheat</strong>, which tends to have <strong>higher protein and higher gluten</strong> levels.

            Your notes also highlight soil composition: European soil is described as having higher <strong>sulfur</strong> content, which may reduce

            One clear difference is <strong>enrichment</strong>: in the United States, enrichment is required for many grain products and must be labeled,
            adding nutrients such as <strong>iron, B vitamins, and folic acid</strong>. In the EU, enrichment is not necessary; if it is done, nutrients

            Boyar et al. (2025) found cross-country differences in whether kids can identify unprocessed foods as healthier.
            Mexico and Chile had the highest rates of children recognizing an apple as healthier than apple juice with added sugars.
            The United States had the lowest correct response rate.

            Your notes connect ultra-processed imported foods to high obesity rates in some Pacific Island communities, especially where communities are poorer
            and rely on cheaper imported processed foods. These patterns are associated with higher risks of cardiovascular issues and diabetes.
